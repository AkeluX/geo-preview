# Geo Preview

Geo Preview (working title) is currently a minimalistic preview tool for KML and GeoJSON. Files can be dropped on the globe for a quick preview. Dropping new files remove the shapes from previous files.

The goal of this project is only to demonstrate that [WebWorldWind](https://nasaworldwind.github.io/web/) works properly in [Electron](https://electron.atom.io/) and that loading local files is possible. It does not aim at being useful or well-written.
